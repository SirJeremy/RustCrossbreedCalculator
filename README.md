# Rust Crossbreed Calculator
Program to calculate crossbreeds in Rust. This program will figure out the genes of a crossbreed for you and remember which breeds are its parents. It also prevents you from adding breeds with duplicate genes, so you don't make useless crossbreeds. You could have done this previously with a notepad, but this has streamlined the process.
Currently only available for Windows.

*This program is still in development. It works but more features and improvements are planned.*

### Current features:
* Enter genes
* Have genes of crossbreeds be automatically calculated for you
* See the parents and children of your breeds
* See recent changes in history
* Prevents you from adding breeds with duplicate genes

### Here are planned features:
* Ask before deleting breeds
* Saves (json)
* Loading/exporting genes from/to text files
* Better visuals and highlighting
* Better validation and feedback
* Settings
* Ability to undo

### In the distant future, I also plan on doing:
* Website so you don't have to download a program
* cross-platform app for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and mobile devices
* Crossbreeding algorithm to figure out what to crossbreed to get certain genes
